# ATT Soundpack: Chiptune
This AddOn provides a soundpack for All The Things and changes:

- Fanfare sounds when collecting new things;
- Complete sound when finishing a category of things;
- Remove sound when a thing is removed from the collection;
- RareFind sound when a treasure or rare is detected.

These sounds are themed after the handheld Pok√©mon games and contain sounds from a few different versions of these games (with the exception of the reporting and death sounds).

A proper example of how to create a soundpack now exists [here](https://github.com/DFortun81/ATT-SoundPack-Template).
