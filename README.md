# AllTheThings Soundpack: Pokémon
This AddOn provides a soundpack for All The Things and changes the sounds for:

- Fanfare sounds when collecting new things;
- Complete sound when finishing a category of things;
- Remove sound when a thing is removed from the collection;
- RareFind sound when a treasure or rare is detected.

These sounds are themed after the handheld Pokémon games and contain sounds from a few different versions of these games.

The purpose of this AddOn is to both serve as an actual soundpack, as well as an example for others to create their own soundpacks for All The Things.

This AddOn has no affiliation with the dependent AddOn, All The Things.
